# Welcome to GTDef

_GTDef_ is a set of algorithms created in Matlab for modeling kinematically-described deformation from rectangular dislocations within a half-space, or layer_d medium.

Created by the [Newman Research Group at Georgia Tech](http://geophysics.eas.gatech.edu/anewman).

## Current version
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/283332126.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/283332126)

## Getting started
Within each version (starting with v4.0), there is a documentation directory that contains step-by-step information on how to run the code, with specific case examples.

### running code is easy
```markdown
# Add code to path (in Matlab)
addpath ('/path/to/GTdef/stable/') %replacing with your actual path

# requires only a simple call (in Matlab)
GTdef('example.in')

```
