2 folders give two similar exmaples using unwrapped InSAR LOS and Vertical-only decomposed data.

The examples include the extraction of data from a georeferenced geotiff image

outputs include .in, .txt, and .box files.  
  .in is to be included into an input file for modeling.
  .txt is more human-readable (possibly)
  .box is used to draw the bounds of the quadtree boxes made (in gmt multisegment file format)
