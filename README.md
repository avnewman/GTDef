## GitHub Etiquette

* Keep file paths sensibly short and understandable
* Where feasible, particularly with example problems, use symbolic links to include redundant and large files (e.g. Green's functions)
* Use only standard (non-greek/non-accented characters for file names and variables)
* Do not use spaces in filenames (CamelCaseIsPreferred).
* *Always Pull then Push!*  This will substantially reduce conflict.


## Release Notes
### Version 4.0 is the first public release. 
Future versioning will go with order Version.sub-version.patch (e.g. 4.0.**1**).  
Minor bug fixes will go as patches, as long as they don't change the expected functionality of existing codes. 
Feature additions and major bug fixes will go to sub-version (e.g. 4.**1**).
Any feature change that creates different functionality for existing tools will go in a major version (e.g. **5**.0).
