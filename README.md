[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/283332126.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/283332126)

### Version 4.0 is the first public release. 
* Future versioning will use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (major.minor.patch; e.g. 0.0.0).  
* _Patches_ are minor bug fixes, as long as they don't change the expected functionality of existing codes(e.g. 4.0.**1**). 
* _Minor_ modifications, including feature additions and more substantial fixes will go to sub-version (e.g. 4.**1**.0).
* _Major_ feature change that creates different functionality for existing tools will get a full new version number (e.g. **5**.0.0).

## Version pointers
`GTDef/GTdef/stable` will point to the latest stable release.
`GTDef/GTdef/unstable` will point to the current development version.

## GitHub Etiquette

* Keep file paths sensibly short and understandable
* Where feasible, particularly with example problems, use symbolic links to include redundant and large files (e.g. Green's functions)
* Use only standard (non-greek/non-accented characters for file names and variables)
* Do not use spaces in filenames (CamelCaseIsPreferred).
* *Always Pull then Push!*  This will substantially reduce conflict.
