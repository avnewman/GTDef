## GitHub Etiquette

* Keep file paths sensibly short and understandable
* Where feasible, particularly with example problems, use symbolic links to include redundant and large files (e.g. Green's functions)
* Use only standard (non-greek/non-accented characters for file names and variables)
* Do not use spaces in filenames (CamelCaseIsPreferred).
* *Always Pull then Push!*  This will substantially reduce conflict.
